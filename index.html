    <p>Hello!
        <br>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
        I completed my bachelor's degree in Geography from Lagos State University, and my master's degree in Transport Geography from the University of Lagos. I have worked as an architectural draftsman in more than two firms as a result of my years of experience in the construction industry.
    </p>
        
        
    <p>I currently work in a GIS firm and I must say, it's a better feat for me considering the numbers of projects I and my team have executed. (Well, maybe because I was one of the best students in cartography). The team have served as consultants to many organisations including the Lagos State Government. So far, so good, I have seen what GIS can do in practical sense and in real life applications.
    </p>

<h2>How it all started.....</h2>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
    <p>GIS works hand in hand with python programming so, for the first time I decided to learn programming. I got my nose bruised by the 'brutal snake' (lol) and I had to call it a day. It looked so abstract to me I wasn't even grasping a thing. So, I concluded right there that programming isn't for me. I was done! 
    </p> 
        
    <p>Fortunately, in my unrelenting quest to know programming, I met with JavaScript(2021). I am not saying JS isn't equally difficult, but using it along HTML and CSS(in front end), gives one the opportunity to test and see what one is doing. This is unlike the 'snake guy' which I didn't know how to test run at a go(but I will eventually go back to it later, anyway).
        </p>
        
    <h2>.....and how it's going</h2>
    <p>Now, I have the opportunity to fulfil my dream gifted to me on a platter of gold by  The Stackademic and I promise not to be frightened this time by any downs that comes along with it. Hopefully in the next 6 months, it's going to be a different and a life changing experience.Thanks
    </p>
